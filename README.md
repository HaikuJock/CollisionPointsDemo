# CollisionPointsDemo
Demonstrating possible bug with GameMaker physics collision

Spawn a green triangle with left-mouse-button press (or tap on iOS).
Slam the green triangle into the blue floor repeatedly by moving the mouse cursor (or dragging on iOS) below the floor.
Observe the debug output message, giving a spurious value for phy_collision_x at one of the points.
